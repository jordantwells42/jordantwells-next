                    I am a curious, project-oriented kind of guy.

                    I am currently pursuing a Bachelor&apos;s degree in Chemical Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin, 
                    and supplementing that with a certificate in Elements of Computing. 
                    My major areas of focus have been on computational biology, biotechnology, and computer science.
