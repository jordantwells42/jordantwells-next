        "desc":"I wanted to create a way to generate minimalist, abstract art that you could see the progression of. Using Python, I created a genetic algorithm which takes an input image, and attempt to 'evolve' a copy of it using simple polygons. This is achieved by creating a population of images with random polygons with random colors, selecting the images with the best 'fitness' that most closely resemble the input image, and crossbreeding and mutating the resulting selected images for several generations.",

Typically, generating visualizations of this type using PyMOL can take several minutes and needs to be done hundreds of times to generate designs, so this viewer expedites that process. Built using React and ngl molecular viewer, you can view any protein from the RCSB, explore different residues, and look at interactions between residues. ",
